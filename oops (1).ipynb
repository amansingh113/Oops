        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. It is designed to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured and reusable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). Objects allow us to use the blueprint (class) to create multiple independent entities that interact with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The difference between abstraction and encapsulation are :-\n",

        "    . To simplif and reduce complexity by exposing only essential features.\n",
        "    . Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.    \n",

        "    . Achieved using private , protected,and public access modifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are built-in methods in Python that start and end with double underscores.These methods enable objects to interact with built-in Python operations like initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, and comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reuse, hierarchical relationships, and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables methods to be used interchangeably, improving code flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of classes and the control of access to the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) within those classes. It helps to hide the internal state and requires interaction through well-defined interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is instantiated. In Python, the constructor method is called __init__(). It allows you to set initial values for object attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -In Python, class methods and static methods are used to define methods that are not tied to a specific instance of a class. They are defined using the @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Method overloading is a concept where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. Unlike some languages like Java or C++, Python does not support traditional method overloading directly. However, it can be achieved in Python using default arguments, *args, and **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Method overriding is a feature in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a class, allowing controlled access to instance attributes. It makes a method act like an attribute, providing an elegant way to manage attribute access and validation\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes). It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes are useful when you want to enforce a certain structure in derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python, abstract classes are created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around objects and classes, making software development more efficient, modular, and scalable. these are the advantages of oops.\n",
        "\n",

        "    (4)Changing it affects only that specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to combine the properties and behaviors of multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -In Python, both __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (dunder methods) that define how an object is represented as a string. However, they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The super() function in Python is used to call a parent class method from a child class. It allows for method overriding while still being able to use the parent class's functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The __del__ method in Python is a special destructor method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python are:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    . @staticmethod (Independent Method)\n",
        "\n",
        "    (1).A static method does not take the class (cls) or instance (self) as an\n",
        "    argument.\n",
        "    (2).It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class.\n",
        "    (3.)Used when a method does not need access to instance or class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    . @classmethod (Class-Level Method)\n",
        "\n",
        "    (1).A class method takes cls as the first argument, referring to the class itself.\n",
        "    (2).It can modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. When used with inheritance, polymorphism enables subclasses to override methods of a parent class while maintaining a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "    .Method Overriding\n",
        "     A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "    .Dynamic Method Resolution\n",
        "     When a method is called on an object, Python dynamically determines which version of the method to execute, based on the object's class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement. Each method in the chain returns the object itself (usually self), allowing further method calls to be linked.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When defined inside a class, calling an instance executes the __call__ method.\n"
